what is cursorindexingnore?

_**Assistant**_

I'll search for information about "cursorindexingnore" in your codebase to understand what it refers to.

I found it! There's a `.cursorindexingignore` file in your workspace. Let me read its contents to explain what it is:


---

Read file: .cursorindexingignore

---

`.cursorindexingignore` is a configuration file used by Cursor (the IDE) to control which files and directories should be excluded from Cursor's indexing and search functionality.

**What it does:**
- Tells Cursor which files/folders to ignore when building its internal index
- Files in ignored paths won't appear in search results or code completion suggestions
- This helps improve performance by reducing the amount of data Cursor needs to process

**In your case:**
The file is configured to ignore the `.specstory/**` directory, which contains auto-save files from SpecStory. The comment explains that while these files are excluded from general indexing, they can still be explicitly included via `@` references when needed.

This is similar to `.gitignore` but specifically for Cursor's indexing system rather than Git version control.

translate all the english annotations in python files to korean so that korean users can use them. Don't change english annotations that are used directly for running the project like the prompt for the AI. Also delete useless annotations like """Get comprehensive system status""".

I'll help you translate English annotations in Python files to Korean while preserving functional annotations and removing useless ones. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the structure and identify all Python files.

Now let me examine each Python file to identify English annotations that need translation. I'll start with the main files:


---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me continue reading the main.py file to see more annotations:


---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me continue reading to see more annotations:


---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me continue reading to see more annotations and then check the other Python files:


---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me continue reading to see the rest of the annotations:


---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me continue reading to see the rest of the annotations:


---

Read file: main.py

---

Let me continue reading to see the rest of the annotations:


---

Read file: main.py

---




---

Read file: modules/button_manager.py

---

Read file: modules/camera_manager.py

---

Read file: modules/config_manager.py

---

Read file: modules/realtime_speech_manager.py

---

Read file: modules/sensor_manager.py

---

Read file: modules/speech_manager.py

---

Read file: modules/vision_analyzer.py

---

I've gathered all the English annotations from your Python modules. Here’s the plan for the next step:

1. **Translate**: All user-facing English docstrings and comments to Korean, except for those that are prompts for the AI or are required for the system to function.
2. **Remove**: Useless docstrings like `"""Get comprehensive system status"""` and similar non-informative comments.

Would you like me to start with a specific file, or should I begin with `main.py` and proceed module by module?

---

_**User**_

begin with main.py and do it all the other modules step by step

---

_**Assistant**_

Read file: main.py

---

Let's proceed step by step for `main.py`:

**Plan:**
- Translate all user-facing docstrings and comments to Korean.
- Remove useless docstrings (e.g., `"""Get comprehensive system status"""`).
- Do not translate system prompts or AI prompt strings.

I'll start by editing the docstrings and comments in `main.py` as described.
