# Integrate sensors for assistive glasses (2025-07-21 08:35Z)

_**User**_

Read README.md, examine this project. 
I made a assistive glass for impaired people using python on raspberry pi 3. I intigrated an AI that listens to the user when it's name(Inta) is called. The has many commands like time, weather but the main command is to capture the front with picamera and telling the user what is in front. However I also want the glasses to tell the distance in front when said commands like:

"I need help walking" → Navigation assistance

"Is it safe to walk forward?" → Obstacle detection

"What's the path like?" → Environment analysis

"Help me navigate" → Navigation guidance



For this function, I get data from the code I already made with C language using arduino. The arduino uses the ultrasound sensor and infrared sensor to get the distance between object in front. The code gets only the data in centimeter.



I get the distance data from the C language arduino code and send it to my python code(sensor_manager.py) through serial communication. Intigrate the sensor_manager.py to inta_ai_manager.py. Make the AI to understand the command that makes the AI use the sensor_manager.py code to support the user.

**Summary of the integration and next steps:**

- I have integrated the `sensor_manager.py` into `inta_ai_manager.py` so that the AI can now use real sensor data for navigation, obstacle detection, and distance queries.
- The AI will respond to commands like "I need help walking", "Is it safe to walk forward?", "What's the path like?", and "Help me navigate" by calling the Arduino sensor and giving real feedback based on the measured distance.
- The command recognition logic is updated to robustly trigger navigation/distance/obstacle detection for a wide range of natural language phrases.
- The contextual command system (using OpenAI) already maps navigation/obstacle/distance requests to the correct function, so it will also use the real sensor data.

**How it works for the user:**
- When the user says any of the navigation/obstacle/distance-related commands, the AI will check the distance using the Arduino sensors and provide a spoken response about the safety of the path ahead.

**You can now test this by running your system and using the relevant voice commands.**

If you want further customization (e.g., more detailed feedback, logging, or additional sensor logic), let me know!

does the code continously get the data? The arduino code gets the data every 0.1 seconds. Make the AI analyze the data continously and warn every 1 second

The code now supports **continuous real-time obstacle monitoring**:

- The Arduino still sends data every 0.1 seconds.
- The new `SensorMonitor` class in `sensor_manager.py` runs in the background, always updating the latest distance.
- When the user asks for navigation help (e.g., "I need help walking"), the AI:
  - Starts a background thread that checks the latest distance every 1 second.
  - If the situation changes (e.g., an obstacle appears or disappears), the AI will **speak a warning or update every second**.
  - This monitoring continues for 30 seconds (you can adjust this duration).

**How it works for the user:**
- When navigation/obstacle/distance help is requested, the AI will immediately respond with the current situation and then keep warning the user every second if the situation changes (e.g., a new obstacle appears or is cleared).

**You can adjust:**
- The monitoring duration (currently 30 seconds).
- The warning thresholds (currently <50cm = warning, <150cm = caution).

**No further action is needed from you to enable continuous monitoring.**  
If you want to make the monitoring last until the user says "stop" or want to customize the logic, let me know!

can you make a test file for the sensor_manager.py to test it in my windows computer?
