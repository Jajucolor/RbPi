# STT System Improvements

## Overview

The Speech-to-Text (STT) system in the INTA AI Manager has been completely rebuilt based on the reference code provided. The improvements focus on better microphone detection and more robust speech recognition.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Improved Microphone Detection

**Before:**
- Complex PipeWire configuration that was system-specific
- Limited fallback mechanisms
- No systematic testing of available microphones

**After:**
- Systematic testing of all available microphones
- Progressive fallback from default to device-specific microphones
- Better error handling and logging
- Based on proven reference code

```python
def _test_microphone_detection(self):
    """Test microphone detection and list available devices"""
    # List all available microphones
    mics = sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names()
    
    # Try default microphone first
    try:
        mic = sr.Microphone()
        return mic
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Default microphone failed: {e}")
    
    # Try different device configurations
    for device_index in range(min(5, len(mics))):
        try:
            mic = sr.Microphone(device_index=device_index)
            return mic
        except Exception as e:
            continue
    
    return None
```

### 2. Enhanced Speech Recognition Testing

**Before:**
- No validation of speech recognition functionality
- Assumed microphone would work without testing

**After:**
- Comprehensive testing of speech recognition
- Validates both audio capture and text recognition
- Better error reporting

```python
def _test_speech_recognition(self, microphone):
    """Test speech recognition with the given microphone"""
    # Configure recognizer settings
    recognizer.energy_threshold = 300
    recognizer.dynamic_energy_threshold = True
    recognizer.pause_threshold = 0.8
    recognizer.non_speaking_duration = 0.5
    recognizer.phrase_threshold = 0.3
    
    # Test listening and recognition
    with microphone as source:
        audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=5, phrase_time_limit=5)
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        return True
```

### 3. Simplified Configuration

**Before:**
- Complex PipeWire setup
- System-specific audio configuration
- Multiple environment variable manipulations

**After:**
- Clean, simple configuration
- Platform-independent approach
- Focus on core functionality

### 4. Better Error Handling

**Before:**
- Limited error reporting
- Difficult to diagnose issues

**After:**
- Comprehensive logging
- Clear error messages
- Step-by-step debugging information

## Configuration Settings

The improved system uses these optimized settings:

```python
# Recognizer settings
recognizer.energy_threshold = 300
recognizer.dynamic_energy_threshold = True
recognizer.pause_threshold = 0.8
recognizer.non_speaking_duration = 0.5
recognizer.phrase_threshold = 0.3
```

## Testing

Two test scripts have been created:

1. **`test_microphone.py`** - Basic microphone and STT testing
2. **`test_inta_stt.py`** - Full INTA AI Manager STT testing

## Usage

To test the improved STT system:

```bash
# Test basic microphone detection
python test_microphone.py

# Test full INTA AI Manager STT
python test_inta_stt.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Microphone Detection**: Systematically tests all available microphones
2. **Improved Reliability**: Validates speech recognition before use
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on different operating systems
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex system-specific configurations

## Troubleshooting

If microphone detection fails:

1. Check if `speech_recognition` is installed: `pip install SpeechRecognition`
2. Verify microphone permissions
3. Run `test_microphone.py` to see available devices
4. Check system audio settings

## Reference Code Integration

The improvements are based on the provided reference code that demonstrated:
- Systematic microphone testing
- Proper error handling
- Clear logging
- Robust speech recognition validation

This approach ensures the STT system is more reliable and easier to debug.
