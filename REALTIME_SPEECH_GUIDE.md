# Real-Time Speech Guide

## 🎙️ **Real-Time Speech System**

Your INTA AI now has **real-time speech synthesis** that speaks each word as it's generated, making conversations much more natural and responsive!

---

## ⚡ **How It Works**

### **Traditional Speech (Before):**
1. AI generates complete response
2. Waits for entire response to finish
3. Speaks the complete response
4. **Result:** Long delays, less natural

### **Real-Time Speech (Now):**
1. AI generates response word by word
2. Each word is spoken immediately
3. Continuous flow of speech
4. **Result:** Instant response, natural conversation

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Current Settings (config.json):**
```json
{
    "speech": {
        "realtime_enabled": true,
        "word_delay": 0.05,      // Delay between words (seconds)
        "sentence_delay": 0.2,   // Delay between sentences (seconds)
        "chunk_size": 2          // Words spoken at once
    }
}
```

### **Speed Options:**

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Very Fast** | `word_delay: 0.02` | Almost instant |
| **Fast** | `word_delay: 0.05` | **Current setting** |
| **Normal** | `word_delay: 0.1` | Natural pace |
| **Slow** | `word_delay: 0.2` | Clear pronunciation |

### **Chunk Size Options:**

| Setting | Value | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Word-by-word** | `chunk_size: 1` | Individual words |
| **Natural** | `chunk_size: 2` | **Current setting** |
| **Phrase-based** | `chunk_size: 3` | Small phrases |
| **Sentence-based** | `chunk_size: 5` | Longer chunks |

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test the Real-Time Speech:**
```bash
python test_realtime_speech.py
```

### **Test Speed Comparison:**
```bash
python test_realtime_speech.py
# Choose option 2 for speed comparison
```

### **Test with Main Application:**
```bash
python main.py
# Then say: "Tell me a joke" or "What time is it?"
```

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

### **Example Response:**
*"I can see a table with a laptop on it. There is also a coffee cup nearby."*

| Method | Time to First Word | Total Time | Naturalness |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Traditional** | 3-5 seconds | 3-5 seconds | ❌ Robotic |
| **Real-Time** | 0.1 seconds | 3-5 seconds | ✅ Natural |

### **Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Instant feedback** - No waiting
- 🎯 **Better engagement** - Natural flow
- 🔄 **Interruptible** - Can stop mid-sentence
- 🎙️ **Conversational** - Like talking to a person

---

## 🔧 **Customization**

### **Adjust Speed:**
```python
# In main.py, modify these settings:
self.speech.set_realtime_settings(
    word_delay=0.02,      # Faster
    sentence_delay=0.1,   # Shorter pauses
    chunk_size=1          # Word-by-word
)
```

### **Add Callbacks:**
```python
def on_word_spoken(word):
    print(f"Spoke: {word}")

def on_sentence_complete(sentence):
    print(f"Completed: {sentence}")

speech.set_callbacks(on_word_spoken, on_sentence_complete)
```

### **Different Languages:**
```python
speech = RealtimeSpeechManager(
    volume=0.9,
    language='es',  # Spanish
    slow=False
)
```

## 🎯 **Use Cases**

### **Perfect For:**
- ✅ **Quick commands** - "What time is it?"
- ✅ **Long responses** - Environment descriptions
- ✅ **Conversations** - Natural back-and-forth
- ✅ **Emergency responses** - Immediate feedback
- ✅ **Interactive games** - Real-time responses

### **Example Scenarios:**

#### **1. Quick Commands:**

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Speech is Too Fast:**
```json
{
    "speech": {
        "word_delay": 0.1,      // Increase delay
        "chunk_size": 3         // Larger chunks
    }
}
```

### **If Speech is Too Slow:**
```json
{
    "speech": {
        "word_delay": 0.02,     // Decrease delay
        "chunk_size": 1         // Smaller chunks
    }
}
```

### **If Audio Cuts Out:**
- Check microphone permissions
- Verify audio device settings
- Restart the application

### **If Words are Unclear:**
```json
{
    "speech": {
        "word_delay": 0.15,     // Slower for clarity
        "chunk_size": 1         // Word-by-word
    }
}
```
