## Troubleshooting INTA's Continuous Microphone

### Common Issues with Always-Active Microphone

**üîä Audio Feedback Loop (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: INTA hears its own voice and responds in a loop
- **Solution**: **Always use headphones** when running INTA
- **Alternative**: Mute speakers when INTA is talking (requires additional setup)
- **Test**: Run `python3 test_inta_conversation.py` with and without headphones

**üéôÔ∏è Microphone Not Detected**
- **Check microphone**: `arecord -l` should list your USB microphone
- **Test recording**: `arecord -d 3 -f cd test.wav` then `aplay test.wav`
- **USB power**: Try different USB ports, some provide more power
- **Permissions**: Add user to audio group: `sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER`

**üó£Ô∏è Poor Voice Recognition**
- **Background noise**: Use a directional USB microphone
- **Distance**: Stay within 2 feet of microphone for best results
- **Audio quality**: Check `python3 test_voice_commands.py` recognition accuracy
- **Model size**: Try larger Whisper model in config: `"model_size": "small"` or `"medium"`

**‚ö° High CPU Usage**
- **Whisper model**: Use `"base"` model for lower CPU usage
- **Chunk duration**: Increase `"chunk_duration": 3.0` in config to reduce processing frequency
- **Background processes**: Close unnecessary applications

**üîÑ INTA Not Responding**
- **Check microphone status**: Look for "üéôÔ∏è INTA continuous listener started" in logs
- **Audio stream**: Verify "Continuous audio stream initialized" message
- **Conversation priority**: Ensure `"conversation_priority": true` in config
- **Test manually**: Use interactive mode in `test_inta_conversation.py`

**üì¶ Missing Dependencies**
- **PyAudio installation**: `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`
- **Whisper dependencies**: `pip install openai-whisper torch`
- **Audio libraries**: `sudo apt install alsa-utils`

### Debugging Commands

**Check INTA Status:**
```bash
# In Python interactive shell
python3 -c "
from modules.voice_command_manager import VoiceCommandManager
vm = VoiceCommandManager()
print(vm.get_microphone_status())
"
```

**Monitor Audio Levels:**
```bash
# Real-time audio monitoring
alsamixer
# Or monitor recording levels
arecord -vv -f cd /dev/null
```

**Test Continuous Audio Stream:**
```bash
# Test microphone with continuous recording
python3 -c "
import pyaudio
import time
pa = pyaudio.PyAudio()
stream = pa.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, frames_per_buffer=1024)
print('Microphone active - speak now!')
for i in range(50):  # 5 seconds
    data = stream.read(1024)
    print(f'Audio chunk {i}: {len(data)} bytes')
    time.sleep(0.1)
stream.close()
pa.terminate()
"
```
